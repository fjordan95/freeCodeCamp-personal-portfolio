      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I began looking into web development recently when I decided it was time for a change of career. I have a background in education and am looking to take some of those skills to a new sector. I am beginning with freeCodeCamp.org and am looking forward to gaining as many skills as possible. My current goal is to study full stack web development with a focus on front-end. However, I'm open to pursuing as many paths as possible.</p>
